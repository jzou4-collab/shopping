  <h1>Project 3 – Shopping Discount Calculator</h1>

  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <p><strong>1.</strong> Name a situation where you would need to create an “if” statement.</p>
  <p><em>Answer:</em> You would use an “if” statement to check conditions — for example, if a user spends more than $100, they get a discount.</p>

  <p><strong>2.</strong> When comparing values, in what data type is the result stored?</p>
  <p><em>Answer:</em> When comparing values, the result is stored as a Boolean (true or false).</p>

  <script>
    // Step 1: Ask the customer for their shopping total
    let total = prompt("How much did you spend?");

    // Convert input to a number
    total = Number(total);

    // Step 2: Confirm the total
    let confirmed = confirm("$" + total + " total? Click OK to continue");

    // Step 3–5: Use if/else statements for discounts
    if (confirmed) {
      if (total >= 100) {
        alert("20% off");
      } else if (total >= 50) {
        alert("10% off");
      } else {
        alert("No discount");
      }
    } else {
      alert("You canceled the confirmation.");
    }
